                                xpbm v0.1

xpbm is a pbm assistance program for X-Window.  Currently it reads
only VMAP files.  Some day, it may read other file formats.  xpbm 
does not know the rules to any games, it is strictly the online
equivalent of cardboard.


INSTALLATION
============

Type make.  If it busts let me know, or fix it, and send me the patch.
Some day I may get around to making a configure script if it is
necessary.


RUNNING
=======

Unfortunately you have to start the program in the same directory you 
have the VMAP file in.  Eventually I would like to have it search some
path for VMAP files, and have some kind of friendlier selection system.

* Select File - Import VMAP menu item to open a VMAP file.  

* Left click on the map to bring up a unit selection window.  

* Left down click on a unit to begin moving the unit, and release the 
button to finish moving the unit.

* Right click on a counter to bring up the unit properties window.  

* Hit escape to banish either window.  

* Shift down left click to start a line, and release the button to 
complete the line.  

* To erase all lines, use the File - Erase Lines menu item.
