QBoard is a Qt 4.3/4.4 application for playing near-arbitrary board games. It provides a fairly rich interface for setting up and playing such games. It is mainly intended as a prototyping platform for testing/playing my own boardgame designs, but may be interesting for other boardgame/wargame/PBEM fans.

PS: If you were looking for the QBoard chess program, this is not it. That program is apparently no longer maintained. I was unaware of it (and its name) before naming this project, or this one would have been renamed to QGameBoard (or similar).
