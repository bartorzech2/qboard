To build QBoard you need one of:

 - Qt 4.4.0+
 - Qt 4.3.5+ (it might work with 4.3.0-4.3.4)

You will need to edit the file config.qmake and set the top-most value
(TOP_SRCIDR) to THIS directory (unfortunately, we can't seem to
programatically get a proper absolute path to the top srcdir from
subdirs in qmake)

Then just type:

     qmake
     make

The binary/binaries will be in ./bin, and can be run from there or
copied to a directory of your choice.
