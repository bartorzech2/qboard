<h1>Welcome to QBoard</h1>
<h2>Home page: <a href='http://wanderinghorse.net/gaming/QBoard/'>http://wanderinghorse.net/gaming/QBoard/</a></h2>

QBoard is a program for setting up and playing nearly arbitrary board-style games.
Just like a real board game, it knows nothing about the rules. Instead, it provides
a "playing surface" on top of which can be done whatever one wishes.

<br/><br/>

As QBoard is based on the <a href='http://www.trolltech.com/qt'>Qt4 library</a>, QBoard is implicitly
released under the terms of the GNU General Public License, version 2 or 3.


<h2>Brief HOWTO</h2>
A brief guide on how to do thing in QBoard...

<h3>The QBoard home directory:</h3>

  To allow us to save relative paths in our data files, we need a common root directory which is portable
across platforms. To that end, we request that you store all QBoard-related data files under the QBoard
home directory (<tt></tt>~/.QBoard</tt>). QBoard tries its best to make sure you stay inside the home directory. For example,
when loading graphics files for pieces and boards, it uses a path relative to the home, if possible, as this makes
the saved data portable to other machines (or if the QBoard home dir changes).

<br/><br/>

Before getting started with QBoard, you will need to put some files in the home dir, namely:

<ul>
<LI>Graphics for boards.</LI>
<LI>Graphics for pieces.</LI>
<LI>Any .txt or .html files you may want to load from within QBoard.</LI>
</ul>

You may structure your data however you like under the home directory, with the exception that the
subdirectory named <tt>QBoard</tt> is reserved for use with QBoard-specific application data.

<h3>Loading</h3>

<ul>
<LI>Double-clicking an image file will load it as a game board (if it is bigger than 10KB) or a game piece (if it is smaller).</LI>
<LI>Double-clicking on files named *.GameState, *.QBoard, or *.QBoardPiece will load a game, a board, or a piece. The
same happens when using the Open File menu/button.
</LI>
<li>Double-clicking a .txt or .html file will open it in a browser.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Saving</h3>

<ul>
<li>To save a game, click the Save button or File->Save menu item. That will save the entire game state.
</li>
</ul>
