<h1>Welcome to QBoard</h1>
<h2>Home page: <a href='http://code.google.com/p/qboard'>http://code.google.com/p/qboard</a></h2>

QBoard is a program for setting up and playing nearly arbitrary board-style games.
Just like a real board game, it knows nothing about the rules. Instead, it provides
a "playing surface" on top of which can be done whatever one wishes.


<br/><br/>

As QBoard is based on the <a href='http://www.trolltech.com/qt'>Qt4 library</a>,
QBoard is released under the terms of the GNU General Public License version 2 or 3.


<h2>Brief HOWTO</h2>
A brief guide on how to do thing in QBoard...

<h3>The QBoard home directory:</h3>

To allow us to save relative paths in our data files, we need a common
root directory which is portable across platforms. To that end, we
request that you store all QBoard-related data files under the QBoard
home directory (<tt>~/.QBoard</tt>). QBoard tries its best to
make sure you stay inside the home directory. For example, when
loading graphics files for pieces and boards, it uses a path relative
to the home, if possible, as this makes the saved data portable to
other machines (or if the QBoard home dir changes).

<br/><br/>

Before getting started with QBoard, you will need to put some files in the home dir, namely:

<ul>
<LI>Graphics for boards.</LI>
<LI>Graphics for pieces.</LI>
<LI>Any .txt or .html files you may want to load from within QBoard.</LI>
</ul>

You may structure your data however you like under the home directory,
with the exception that the subdirectory named <tt>QBoard</tt> is
reserved for use with QBoard-specific application data.

<h3>Loading</h3>


<ul>
<LI>Double-clicking an image file will load it as a game board (if it
is bigger than 10KB) or a game piece (if it is smaller).</LI>
<LI>Double-clicking on files named *.GameState, *.QBoard, or
*.QBoardPiece will load a game, a board, or a piece. The same happens
when using the Open File menu/button.
</LI>
<li>Double-clicking a .txt or .html file will open it in a browser (only when
compiled against Qt 4.4!).</li>
</ul>

<h3>Saving</h3>

<ul>
<li>To save a game, click the Save button or File->Save menu item. That will save the entire game state.
</li>
</ul>
