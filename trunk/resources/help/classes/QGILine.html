<strong>Using the QGILine widget:</strong>

<p>
QGILine represents a line between two points on a game board. This is
often useful for marking movement paths (or histories), firing ranges,
lines of fire, and such. The line itself cannot be directly
manipulated - instead, right-click the dots on each end to change the
line's properties or remove it from the board. To adjust the line,
simply drag the ends around. If you select both ends (using
drag/select or ctrl+click), dragging one will move them both.
