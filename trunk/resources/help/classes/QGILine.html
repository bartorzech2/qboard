<strong>Using the QGILine widget:</strong>

<p>
QGILine represents a line between two points on a game board.  This is
often useful for marking movement paths (or histories), firing ranges,
lines of fire, and such. The itself cannot be manipulated - instead,
right-click the dots on each end to change the line's properties or
remove it from the board. To adjust the line, simply drag the ends
around. If you select both ends (using drag/select), dragging one will
move them both.
