<strong>Using the QGIHtml widget:</strong><br/><br/>
QGIHtml is a text/HTML widget for placing text directly onto a QBoard.<br/>
<strong>Tips:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Right-click to get the context menu.</li>
<li>Double-click to edit it in-line.</li>
<li>Double-middle-click to open an editor dialog, where you can edit it as HTML.</li>
</ul>
Note that this widget supports only a subset of HTML, as described in the API
section named 'Supported HTML Subset' in the Qt Assistant documentation.
Also note that QTextEdit::setHtml() likes to mangle your HTML a bit,
so don't be alarmed when it changes between edits.
