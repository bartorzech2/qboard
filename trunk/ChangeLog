This is the informal ChangeLog for the QBoard project. Newest items
are at the top.

========================================================================

2008 June 14:

- Too many little changes to remember.

- Added initial copy/cut support.  Paste is on the todo list, but
pasting is inherently target- and source-specific, so that'll take a
bit of work.


2008 June 13:

- Initial release via Google Code.
