#summary How to compile QBoard

= Compiling QBoard =

QBoard uses Qt's qmake tool for its build process, the goal being to have a single build process which can, in theory, run on any system supported by Qt.

QBoard needs Qt version 4.3.x or 4.4.x, and you will need to have Qt's development files (headers/libs) in a suitable place on your system (where your compiler and linker can find them).

= Unix systems =

To build QBoard, simply:

{{{
~> qmake
~> make
}}}

The application will compile to `bin/QT_VERSION/QBoard`. To install it, simply copy it to your favourite binaries directory (e.g. `~/bin` is good).


= Non-Unix systems =

Instructions for building it on non-Unix environments would be appreciated, if anyone gets it working.
