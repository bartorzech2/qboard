= Creating screencasts using ffmpeg =

While experimenting with creating demo videos for QBoard, i had to tinker
quite a lot to get the video capture working how i wanted it. For anyone
doing screencasts (whether of QBoard or not), here's a simple shell script
which can simplify the process:

{{{
#!/bin/bash
# Generates an ffmpeg command line for capturing a given X11 window.
# Usage: $0 [optional output file name]
# It will prompt you to click on the window you want to capture.
# Output is simply echoed, for use in copy/pasting (adjusting/adding
# parameters as needed).
# Tip: the command uses screen coordinates, so do not resize or move
# the target window once capturing as begun.
echo "Click the window to capture..."
geom=$(xwininfo 2>/dev/null | grep "geometry ")
if [[ x = "x${geom}" ]]; then
    echo "Invalid geometry or -geometry flag not found in xwininfo output"
    exit 1
fi
echo "Geometry: ${geom}"
size=$(echo $geom | perl -pe 's|\D+ +(\d+x\d+).*|$1|')
pos=$(echo $geom | perl -pe 's|.*\+(\d+)\+(\d+).*|$1,$2|')
echo "pos=$pos size=$size"

out=${1-screengrab.avi}
test -f $out && rm $out

framerate=4
echo "# ffmpeg command"
echo -n "sleep 2; " # give caller time to switch to captured window
echo ffmpeg -f x11grab \
    -r ${framerate} \
    -s ${size} \
    -i ${DISPLAY-0:0}+${pos} \
    -sameq \
    $out

}}}


It's used like this:

{{{
stephan@jareth:/space/stephan$ ./screencap.sh
Click the window to capture...
Geometry:   -geometry 598x686+764+0
pos=764,0 size=598x686
# ffmpeg command
sleep 2; ffmpeg -f x11grab -r 4 -s 598x686 -i :0.0+764,0 -sameq screengrab.avi
}}}

The output is intended to be copy/pasted to your shell (or script, or whatever), adding or adjusting parameters as necessary. The `sleep` call is helpful when running the command from a shell, as it gives the caller time to click on the target window before ffmpeg starts capturing.
