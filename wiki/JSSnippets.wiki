= Introduction =

Here is a collection of JavaScript snippets which can be used with QBoard.

*Achtung*: as the JS bindings are very much a work in progress, there are no guarantees that any of these snippets will work with a particular QBoard version. Have faith that they have been shown to work in at least one version of QBoard :).

= Creating new pieces =

A new dot:

{{{
qboard.createObject('QGIDot',{
    pos:qboard.placementPos(),
    color:'red'
});
}}}


A new HTML item:
{{{
qboard.createObject('QGIHtml',{
    pos:qboard.placementPos(),
    html:'this is my text'
});
}}}


A new graphical piece:
{{{
qboard.createObject('QGIPiece',{
    pos:qboard.placementPos(),
    pixmap:'mygame/counters/soldier.png'
});
}}}


= Destroying items =

{{{
var pc = qboard.createObject(...);
...
pc.deleteLater();
}}}

The `deleteLater()` routine queues the item for deletion once the current event handling queue is at a safe point. Because of a potential delay, after calling deleteLater(), pc should be treated as a null pointer, even though it might technically (and briefly) still be alive. Note that:

{{{
delete pc;
}}}

is NOT the same. That only deletes the script-side representation of the object, and not the native (C++-side) object.
