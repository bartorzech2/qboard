#summary Utility code for serializing Qt data using libs11n

= Serializing Qt-based objects using libs11n =

Since i'm the maintainer of the s11n project (http://s11n.net), a library for serializing
objects in C++, QBoard uses libs11n for its serialization needs (that is, loading and saving). As QBoard develops, code is written to bind Qt-based types to the s11n serialization framework. That code is independent of QBoard and may be helpful to coders working on arbitrary Qt-based projects.

The code is available via the QBoard source tree (look for `src/*11n*.*`) or as a separate download on the downloads page (look for `s11n-qt-VERSION.tar.gz`, though those versions may be older than what is the in the current QBoard tree).

The distribution contains code for de/serializing the following Qt types:

  * QString, both ASCII and Unicode strings (though it internally uses different formats for each).
  * Most of the commonly-used utility classes, including: QPoint, QColor, QRect, QSize, QLine, QPolygon, QPair, QFont, QDate/Time/DateTime.
  * QByteArray and QPixmap, with compression
  * Many (but not all) forms of QVariant.
  * QList, QStringList, QVector, QMap
  * QObject properties. They are internally stored as QVariants, which implies that only property values of QVariant types supported by this code will work for purposes of serialization.

The code gets pretty heavy use in QBoard and is believed to work quite well.

Suggestions, fixes, etc., are of course always welcome.

Happy hacking!
