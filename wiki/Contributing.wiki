The main reason for moving QBoard to Google Code was to help attract other developers. With more developers, each with their own views of right and wrong, which QLayout to use, and which shade of pink looks best on Madonna, really increases the innovation level of a project.

Some particular areas i'd like to see _someone else_ work are:

  * Figuring out how to solve the weird bugs which show up in Qt4.3 but not 4.4.
  * A graphics wiz to help add more features to the QGraphicsView-based parts.
  * Custom game graphics would be really cool. i've actually got tons of them, but i'm no graphics artist and have no real talent for making _nice looking_ graphics.
  * Windows platforms. i don't have any of them, but i'd love to see it working on Windows.
  * Improved drag/drop support. e.g. it appears to be impossible to drag items across different QGraphicsViews, even if they all belong to the same QGraphicsScene. The drag/drop support and copy/paste implementations are closely related, actually, and the copy/cut works already (well, for Serializable types, anyway), whereas paste is a tad bit trickier.
