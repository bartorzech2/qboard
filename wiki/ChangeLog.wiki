= QBoard ChangeLog =

This is the informal ChangeLog for the QBoard project. Newest items
are at the top.

----
2008 August 11:

- Added "piece templates" to the main UI. The appearance of the
currently-selected template is used as the basis when loading piece
graphics from files. All changed made to the piece templates are
persistant across QBoard sessions.

- Fixed the mis-scaling of boards in Qt 4.3.

2008 August 9:

- Corrected several compile warnings caught by gcc 4.2.3.

2008 June 15:

- Fixed a major bug under Qt 4.3 which caused non-piece gameboard items
to be not removed. The end effect was duplicate or extra items at
load-time.

- The main app can now process .qbbatch script files (the same files
read by qboardbatch).


2008 June 14:

- Fixed the broken app icons for qt 4.3. This was caused by an inconsistency
in how Qt Designer 4.3/4.4 handle icons associated with QActions.

- Too many little changes to remember.

- Added initial copy/cut support.  Paste is on the todo list, but
pasting is inherently target- and source-specific, so that'll take a
bit of work.

- Board now has a popup menu with a couple options. You wouldn't believe
what a bitch it was to get the event handling right in conjunction with
overlapping pieces and the board.


2008 June 13:

- Initial release via Google Code.
