= QBoard ChangeLog =

This is the informal ChangeLog for the QBoard project. Newest items
are at the top.

----
*2008 August 17:*

- Significant improvements in copy/paste, including:

  * Ctrl-C/Ctrl-X/Ctrl-V do the conventional things. Copy/cut requires that the board have at least one selected item.
  * Pasting with the mouse over the board will paste to that board position, otherwise it will try to restore the original position where the data was copied/cut from.

- Added underlying support to allow libs11n to (indirectly) use QIODevices as input/output source/targets. That means we can't serialize directly to, e.g. QFile or QBuffer.


*2008 August 17:*

- QGIHtml (the on-board text widgets) can now be rotated.

- Improved pasting a bit. e.g.
  * pasted objects are now selected by default, since the most common action after a paste is adjusting the position of the group.
  * Can now paste more types of data into the game (namely GamePiece, QBoard, and Serializable QGraphicsItems).

- Clipboard is now better synchronized with the global Qt/X11 clipboard.


=== *2008 August 16:* ===

- Added s11n support for QMap, plus QByteArray and QPixmap with compression.


*2008 August 15:*

- Added quicksave/quickload (Alt-S and Alt-L), which save/load to/from a predefined game file.

- Added ability to serialize QDate, QTime, and QDateTime properties.

- The "Clear board" action now leaves the underlying board graphic intact. This was an accident, but i like it better this way, so it stays.

- Fixed: board view now updates properly when a new board graphic is loaded. That is,
one no longer has to scroll the board to get the new image to show up.

- Added "Help" context menu item to some in-game objects.

- Copy/cut/paste is basically working. On-board lines don't paste in the proper location, but that's part of a bigger problem. Unfortunately, we can't currently bind keyboard shortcuts to copy/cut/paste because where those are caught we don't have access to the necessary widgets to initiate the copy/paste.

*2008 August 13:*

- Added a "placemarker" to the board. Pieces loaded via double-clicking
in the file browser will be set to the placemarker's position. To move
the placemarker, middle-click the board or drag the placemarker around.

- Added basic skeleton code for plugins support, using Qt's plugins framework.
It's not well integrated yet (you can't select plugins to open), but i was able
to load a plugin which had compiled-in PNG files (as resources), and was able
to use those resources as pixmap sources for in-play pieces. So the basics
seem to work, anyway.


*2008 August 11:*

- Added "piece templates" to the main UI. The appearance of the
currently-selected template is used as the basis when loading piece
graphics from files. All changed made to the piece templates are
persistant across QBoard sessions.

- Fixed the mis-scaling of boards in Qt 4.3.

- Minimaps now keep their scale when a new board is loaded.

- Added basic support for locking a piece's position (simply disables dragging for the piece).


*2008 August 9:*

- Corrected several compile warnings caught by gcc 4.2.3.

*2008 June 15:*

- Fixed a major bug under Qt 4.3 which caused non-piece gameboard items
to be not removed. The end effect was duplicate or extra items at
load-time.

- The main app can now process .qbbatch script files (the same files
read by qboardbatch).


*2008 June 14:*

- Fixed the broken app icons for qt 4.3. This was caused by an inconsistency
in how Qt Designer 4.3/4.4 handle icons associated with QActions.

- Too many little changes to remember.

- Added initial copy/cut support.  Paste is on the todo list, but
pasting is inherently target- and source-specific, so that'll take a
bit of work.

- Board now has a popup menu with a couple options. You wouldn't believe
what a bitch it was to get the event handling right in conjunction with
overlapping pieces and the board.


*2008 June 13:*

- Initial release via Google Code.
