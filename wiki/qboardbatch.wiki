qboardbatch (we'll all it qbb for short) is part of the QBoard distribution. It is a command-line tool which reads in a simple batch scripting language for constructing games. Practice has shown that it is often useful to be able to create game data from existing sets of game files, and this tool was created to support that.

Here's a sample script:

{{{
// sample qboardbatch script
board
set pixmap maps/mymap.jpg

// Create a new piece:
new piece
// Set properties of the piece:
set pixmap mygame/counters/infantry.png
set color #ff0000 // colors can be in "#rrgggbb" or "R G B"
set colorAlpha 100
set pos 100 150
// qbb knows what data type to use for most common piece properties,
// but for custom properties it is sometimes useful to tell it to
// interpret a value as a specific type:
set -point customPointProperty 10 20
set -color customColor #00ff00

// Create another piece:
new piece
set pixmap mygame/counters/heavy_tank.png
set color 128 128 255
set pos 10 20

// Save the game:
save
// If you want to save to stdout instead of a file,
// just leave off the 'mygame' part.
}}}

To anyone who's scripted anything before, what that is doing should be more or less obvious.

Assuming we saved that in a file named `mygame`, we would process it like:

{{{
~> qboardbatch mygame
}}}

The generated file will (if all goes well) be readable by QBoard. It's also readable by you, in case you feel the need to hand-edit it. Note that the exact file format is not defined, as the underlying serialization layer is ignorant of specific formats and can has support for 6 or 7 formats.
