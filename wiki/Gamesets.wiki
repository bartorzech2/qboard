#summary Overview of available gamesets

= QBoard gamesets =

A "gameset", in the context of QBoard, is simply a collection of graphics and/or
text files for use with a specific game. QBoard places no inherent limitations
on the structure of the directories in a gameset or the names of its files.


= Creating your own sets =

Creating gamesets is trivial - you simply need some graphics and/or text/html files for content. Take a look at the above sets below to see a few possible ways to structure sets.
QBoard is very free-form and will allow you to use any directory structure you like. A set with only a few graphics might just put them all in one directory. A set with 20 different types of pieces might break then down by category or team team, for example.

= Available sets =

Below are short descriptions of the gamesets released via the downloads page. To
install a given gameset, simply unpack it to your QBoard home directory.

== [http://www.classicbattletech.com/ BattleTech](tm) and friends ==

This set includes lots of pieces (but no maps) compatible with the [http://www.classicbattletech.com/ BattleTech line of games]. They can also be used for other games with mecha, of course.
You can actually find many BattleTech maps in PDF format at:

[http://www.classicbattletech.com/index.php?action=downloads]

Search that page for "map". But you'll need to extract them from the PDFs before using them with QBoard (their license doesn't allow us to redistribute them here).


== CGME Joe ==

*Joe* is a simple strategy combat game where little plastic army men
do combat on a chessboard. Joe is an original title, created as
part of the CounterMoves project. It can be learned and played in under
half an hour.

== Steve Jackson's Ogre/G.E.V. ==

[http://sjgames.com/ogre/ Ogre/G.E.V.] are classic sci-fi strategy games
by [http://sjgames.com Steve Jackson] depicting armored combat in near-future
nuclear battlefields. This set includes a compilation of playing pieces and
maps for use with those games. The maps were originally
distributed as part of the V_MAP Ogre gameset, but V_MAP has long be defunct.
The pieces come in two forms:

  * The V_MAP set: 35x35-pixel (small) pieces from the V_MAP set.
  * The "Cisco" set: 48x48-pixel (1/2 inch) pieces created by Francisco "Cisco" Cestero, originally intended as printable replacements for the official game counters. The "Cisco" counters (48x48 pixels) are best used with enlarged copies of the included maps, as they are larger than the hexes of those maps. Even better, use a scanned copy of the original maps (which look a lot better than the included ones, but cannot be legally redistributed).

While QBoard won't stop you from using those two sets can be used together, they use
different graphics styles and scales, so interchanging them is not recommended.

The counters all come in the classical black-on-white and white-on-black combinations, plus with transparent backgrounds, so one can use custom colors.
